h1. Resumable File Uploads for HTML5

These are the skeleton files for providing resumable file uploads in Rails.


h2. How it works

# You drag and drop a large file for uploading (or use file input, yawn)
# Using JavaScript FileAPI we send a simple fingerprint of the file to the server
#* filename, file size, modified date - the user is also taken into account, determined by the current session data
# The server looks for an existing matching file
#* If not found it creates a new one
#* Then it returns the file_id and the part of the file we are up to
# The JavaScript looks at the response then sends the next part of the file
# The server appends the part to the file then requests the next part
# ...

I've defined the part size to be a constant 1mb (1024 x 1024). Feel free to adjust this as you see fit.


h2. Using it with Rails 3

I've made the following assumptions
* You are validating users before letting them upload

h3. Basic Usage

Coming sooon. Code works, just need to put the finishing touches on the Engine version.

The client side code was refactored and inspired by: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-html5-upload/
